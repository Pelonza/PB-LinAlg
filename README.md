# PB-LinAlg
Activity and Problem based Linear Algebra materials, designed for a 1/2 semester course.

This Repository contains previous course material from Valparaiso University's course: MATH 260 Linear Systems and Matrices.

MATH 260 Linear Systems and Matrices is essentially a 1/2 semester course on the basics of Linear Algebra. The official description is:
Students will study properties of, and solutions to, linear equations and system of linear equations. Related topics include matrices, properties of matrices, matrix algebra, determinants, eigenvalues, real vectors in two and three dimensions, vector algebra (including dot and cross products), linear combinations, and linear independence.

Note that the course is only worth 1 credit hour, and largely serves our Engineering students or other non-math majors that need linear algebra.

----------
The respository contains old course materials for running it using a "flipped" classroom style, or psuedo-inquiry based style. That is a typical course day consists of:

1) A pre-class exercise (Class Preparation Assignment or CPA), sometimes include a video or readings from a textbook. 

2) An In-class worksheet that explores the topic

3) A post-class homework problem.

----------

Not included in this repository are links to all the CPA videos etc. Many videos were drawn from either Khan Academy or PatrickJMT. At some point I may include a listing of these specific videos...

----------

Spring 2014 - Schmitt -- Contains some of the original worksheets, which include student learning objectives for each class. However, they also contain some typos, and need some revising.

Fall 2014 - Capaldi -- Contains updated/revised CPAs and worksheets, without learning objectives.
